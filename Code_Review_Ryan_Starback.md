Programmers: Isabella Cedric, Matthew Greenberg, Matthew Schwab
Code Reviewer: Ryan Starback

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4.5 based on the following criteria:
 * Was able to compile
 * Oversight on original review, login button not functioning correctly
 * Didn't see that it had to be documented according to Chapman Coding Standards originally -- changed score to reflect

1  I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2  At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically: Login button not working.

5  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards.
Specifically: The login button seems to be malfunctioning, code doesn't comply with Chapman Coding Standards

6  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):
 * More consistent spacing
 * Try to reduce size of some functions
 * Overall, looks great! Nice job guys
