On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 3 based on the following criteria:

1  I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2  At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

Added .jar files, but New Login consistently did not compile for me.

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

5  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards.
Specifically:

6  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):
  * Really cool project!
  * Everything worked for me
